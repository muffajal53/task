This program calculates the iterative sequence 
for the set of positive integers

def sequence(n):
	print the n number
	if n number is equal to 1
		nothing to happen
	elif check n number is even
		n number divide by 2 and store in variable with interger value
		recursively call this function with new number
	else
		n number multiply by 3 and add 1 and get interger value in output
		recursively call this function with new number
